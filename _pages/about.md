After a professional reconversion started in 2006 to turn my passion for IT and hacking into a profession. I had the chance to work in various companies of different sizes and very different economic contexts, which allowed me to always look for the best compromise. 

Through this blog I just want to be active in knowledge sharing, bringing my vision of things even if it is obviously subjective.

Thanks to all the communities for sharing knowledge.
